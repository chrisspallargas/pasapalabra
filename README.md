### Click to play: https://chrisspallargas.github.io/pasapalabra/.

Pasapalabra is a words game where, following the alphabet, you have to say the right word according to the current letter you are playing and a definition.

The target is finishing the donut without mistakes.

## Functional description

The only thing you need to do is read the definition and write the answer, then click OK and, if the answer is right, the corresponding letter will turn into green, otherwise, into red. In case you need more time to think about the correct answer but going ahead with the game, just press PASAPALABRA button and the game will ask you about that letter when finishing the donut and restarting it again with the unanswerred ones.
